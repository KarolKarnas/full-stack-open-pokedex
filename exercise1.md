Choosing between self-hosted and cloud-based environments depends on several factors:

    • Resource Availability: Self-hosted environments require dedicated hardware and maintenance, whereas cloud-based solutions offer scalability and maintenance-free setup.
    • Cost Consideration: Self-hosting involves initial setup costs and ongoing maintenance expenses, whereas cloud-based solutions often have pay-per-usage pricing models.
    • Security Requirements: Self-hosting provides more control over security measures and data privacy, while cloud-based solutions may offer built-in security features and compliance certifications.

To make final decision, one would need to consider factors such as budget constraints, scalability needs, security requirements, and team expertise in managing infrastructure.
